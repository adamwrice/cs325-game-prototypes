<h2>Mech Miner</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Similar to a game made in Scratch, I added a different driving mechanic as well as a much larger, tilemapped map.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Tilemapped, and have an on-screen stat overlay
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that trying to make your own map is a pain as well as trying to open a window in the game is really complicated.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Mineral Breaker
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>    
Survive by burning minerals, but be careful not to over heat
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Random ore spawns
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Survival game with on screen stats
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Desperation to find the next mineral
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Move your mech using the arrow keys. Press ‘B’ to burn an ore. Hold down the Spacebar to dig. Your energy will decrease as long as you move and will rapidly decrease when digging. Burn minerals in order to regain energy. If you reach 0 energy your mech will fail and explode. If you burn too many minerals at once, you will overheat and explode. Manage your burning and digging carefully.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Space out the time between burning ore to avoid overheating and leave some time to cool down after digging for extended periods of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Humanity has been forced underground due to harsh climate changes. In doing so, they needed a way to dig efficiently through the Earth’s crust. The Miner Mech was a result of this. However, they needed a way to power it, so they decided on using numerous different types of minerals. Dig, explore, and burn your way through Mech Miner.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>  
5-10 minutes
</li>
