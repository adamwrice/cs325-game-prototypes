<h2>Simple Shape Adventure</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I tried to make a multiplayer platform game where one of the players can be a platform.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Colision is active and so is gravity.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that music is hard to implement and that point and click is much harder to work with than I thought.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Song: <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Kai_Engel/Chapter_Four__Fall/Kai_Engel_-_Chapter_Four_-_Fall_-_08_November">here</a></li>
<li>Starstruck Example game: <a href ="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/starstruck">here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Starstruck.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>    
I wanted a unique platforming experience where the players could work together to get through obstacles.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Mutliplayer platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
None
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
To use tiles to have a moving background, implement music, and collideable sprites that could jump off each other.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Teamwork and platforming skills.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players work together to find the triangle.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Hop off each other to reach platforms that are higher up.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
An astronaut and a magic living square are trying to find the square's lost lover, a triangle.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>  
2-3 minutes
</li>

</ul>
