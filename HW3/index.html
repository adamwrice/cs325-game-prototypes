<h2>High School Reunion Disaster!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I tried to make a matching game with a story
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
You can switch stages
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that implementing a story is a lot easier than coding it in.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Song: <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Kai_Engel/Chapter_Four__Fall/Kai_Engel_-_Chapter_Four_-_Fall_-_08_November">here</a></li>
<li>Matching-Pairs Example game: <a href ="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/matching-pairs">here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Matching-Pairs
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>    
I wanted a unique platforming experience where the players could work together to get through obstacles.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Anniversary of the Last Day of School, Letters Returned, and Winged Person
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Randomized Cards
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Implement gamestates and a story
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Memorization and matching
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Choose how many cards you want to match and then you have 3 minutes to match them all or lose
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Click one and look for its match, but make sure to remember ones you've already been shown
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
It's the 1st North Point High School Reunion and everyone has letters they've written to themselves on their last day of school. A year later, the letters are being distributed again! You are in charge of making sure everyone gets their letter!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>  
3-5 minutes
</li>
