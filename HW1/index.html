<h2>Simon Says! Or does he?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Not very original, but I implemented Simon Says fully.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I mostly just used borrowed code, but I did implement Simon Says effectively
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Reusing code is very effective as long as you know what you're reusing and how it works. And it's very easy to reuse code.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Simon example game: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/simon">here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed the code from the Simon example on the phaser website and added the functionality of Simon not saying Simon Says
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>    
Simon Says online
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Just a fun puzzle game to pass the time.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Random sequence each game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Evaluating events at random.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Just a fun puzzle game to improve short-term memory.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Follow the sequence that Simon Says, but make sure he doesn't try to trick you! Click on each number he selects in the right order in order to progress. An additional number is added each time you get the sequence right.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Memorize the pattern quickly and make sure to double check that Simon Says to follow the sequence instead of just to "Do it".
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Just follow along and don't get stuck! You do what Simon says. And nothing else.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>  
2-3 minutes
</li>

</ul>
